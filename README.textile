h2. Introduction 

DisruptorFailOver is a tool based on the Disruptor framework, produced by LMAX.
It tends to offer a lack of tools offered with this framework, especially:
* a journalisation system
* a replication system
* a marshalling/unmarshalling module
* a communication system as producer
